    <h2>Module 1: Introduction to Engineering Management and Evolution of Management Theories</h2>

    <h3>What is Engineering Management?</h3>
    <p>
        Engineering Management is an art and science of planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling work
        activities to attain and achieve common goals and objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
        It principally deals with the efficient and effective use of the five human resources, namely: manpower, money,
        machines, and time, as the proper, efficient, and effective utilization of these resources with minimal cost and
        a short period of time.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the cost is more and the time is long in doing the work activities, it is not Engineering Management but
        rather Mismanagement.
    </p>

    <h3>Five Basic Management Functions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Planning - deciding in advance what to do and how the work will be done.</li>
        <li>Organizing - the grouping of work activities necessary to attain goals and objectives.</li>
        <li>Staffing – providing personnel with appropriate qualifications and eligibility in an organization.</li>
        <li>Directing – commanding and telling people what to do and how it should be done.</li>
        <li>Controlling – comparing work accomplishments with planned targets and making corrective action if the
            accomplishments differ from the plans.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Four M’s of Management</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Manpower</li>
        <li>Money</li>
        <li>Materials</li>
        <li>Machines</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Basic Elements of Project Management:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Project development and screening</li>
        <li>Project development and design.</li>
        <li>Project appraisal, negotiation, and approval.</li>
        <li>Project implementation</li>
        <li>Project evaluation and screening.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Some Well-Known Personalities in Engineering Management:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Frederick Taylor - "Father of Scientific Management."</li>
        <li>Henri Fayol - "Father of Modern Management."</li>
        <li>Henry Gantt – Emphasized the importance of time and cost in planning and monitoring work activities.</li>
        <li>Mary Parker Follet - Emphasized the importance and value of human relations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Fayol’s 14 Principles of Management:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Division of work - Divide work into specialized tasks and functions, each assigned to a specific individual.
        </li>
        <li>Authority - Authority must be accompanied by responsibility.</li>
        <li>Discipline - Sanctions are necessary to minimize or prevent the recurrence of behavior that violates
            agreed-upon expectations.</li>
        <li>Unity of command - "For any action whatsoever, an employee should receive orders from one superior only."
        </li>
        <li>Unity of direction - There should be "one head and one plan for a group of activities having the same
            objective".</li>
        <li>Subordination - The interest of one employee or group of employees should not prevail over that of the
            organization.</li>
        <li>Remuneration - "Should be fair and, as far as possible, afford satisfaction both to personnel and firm
            (employer and employee)."</li>
        <li>Centralization - The amount of centralization or decentralization necessary to a firm is a function both of
            the size of the firm and the ability of the managers. Organizational effectiveness is increased by
            determining the optimal level of centralization.</li>
        <li>Scalar chain - Hierarchy level of authority; communication is kept open within the chain of command.</li>
        <li>Order - There must be an order in both material and personnel. For material, "things must be in their place
            suitably arranged so as to facilitate all activities". "Perfect order requires that the place be suitable
            for the employee and the employer for the place…the right men in the right place."</li>
        <li>Equity - To encourage employee loyalty and performance. Employers must treat employees fairly, combining
            kindness and justice but not excluding forcefulness or sternness.</li>
        <li>Stability of tenure of personnel - It requires time for the employee to develop skills necessary to perform
            his or her work well. Therefore, successful companies are those with low turnover (high stability of tenure)
            of personnel.</li>
        <li>Initiative - "At all levels of the organizational ladder zeal and energy on the part of employers are
            augmented by initiative (the thinking out and implementation of plans). We should encourage employees to act
            solely."</li>
        <li>Esprit de corps - "Union is strength. Harmony, union among the personnel is great strength in that concern.
            Teamwork and cooperation among people are essentials in the organization."</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Specific Functional Areas of Engineering:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Research – where the engineer is engaged in the process of learning about nature and codifying this
            knowledge into usable theories.</li>
        <li>Design and development – where the engineer undertakes the activity of turning a product concept into a
            finished physical item.</li>
        <li>Testing- where the engineer works in a unit where new products or parts are tested for workability.</li>
        <li>Manufacturing – where the engineer is directly in charge of production personnel or assumes responsibility
            for the product.</li>
        <li>Construction – this is where the construction engineer (a civil engineer) is either directly in charge of
            the construction personnel or may have responsibility for the quality of the construction process.</li>
        <li>Sales – where the engineer assists the company’s customers to meet their needs, especially those that
            require technical expertise.</li>
        <li>Consulting – where the engineer works as a consultant for any individual or organization requiring his
            services.</li>
        <li>Government- where the engineer may find employment in the government performing any of the various tasks in
            regulating, monitoring, and controlling the activities of various institutions, public or private.</li>
        <li>Teaching – where the engineer gets employment in school and is assigned as a teacher of engineering courses.
            Some of them later become Deans, Vice presidents, and Presidents.</li>
        <li>Management – where the engineer is assigned to manage groups of people performing specific tasks.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Evolution of Management Theories</h2>

    <h3>The Classical or Traditional School</h3>
    <p>


        This is built on principles presented by Mooney, Reiley, Gullick, Fayol, Emerson, and Taylor. Classical
        theorists believed and prescribed certain principles that would aid in setting up and managing organizations.
    </p>
    <h4>See Fayol’s Fourteen Principles</h4>

    <p>Scientific Management by Frederick Taylor (1895-1915)</p>
    <p>
        Frederick Taylor – the “father of time study” (He relied on the stopwatch since he focused on the amount of time
        required to complete a particular job). He wrote a book entitled “Principles of Scientific Management”.
    </p>
    <p>
        In his writings, Taylor presented a balanced view of scientific Management. He believed that a “mental
        revolution” would have to take place before management and workers could see that their positions were
        compatible.
    </p>
    <p>
        He pointed out that as productivity rose, the salaries of both the managers and employees would also rise. At
        the same time, he emphasized that managers must avoid such practices as rate cutting because they lead to
        employee hostility toward management.
    </p>
    <h4>Taylor’s Four Principles of Scientific Management:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Develop a science for each element of a man’s work, to replace the old rule-of-thumb method.</li>
        <li>Scientifically select and then train the worker. (In the past, the worker had chosen his own work and
            trained himself as best as he could).</li>
        <li>Heartily cooperate with the men to ensure that all the work done is in accordance with the principles of the
            science developed for the work.</li>
        <li>Divide the work and the responsibility equally between the management and the workers.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        In essence, Taylor’s scientific management stresses the need for developing the best way of performing each job;
        training and preparing the workers to perform that job; and establishing harmonious cooperation between the
        management and the workers so that the job is performed in the desired way.
    </p>

    <h4>The Gilbreths and Motion Study</h4>
    <p>
        Frank and Lilian Gilbreth (1912) emphasized the ideal motions required to perform a job in an optimal fashion.
        They developed the concept of therblig (Gilbreth spelled backward, except for the transposition of H and T ease
        of pronunciation); a therblig is an elemental hand or arm motion.
    </p>

    <h3>Human Relations School</h3>
    <p>
        The human relations theory emphasizes exactly what the classical theory ignored; the human element.
    </p>
    <p>
        The beginnings of this school can be traced back to the study of Elton Mayo (1924-32) and his associates from
        Harvard University of the famous Hawthorne studies at the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric company in the
        United States.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initially, the researchers were interested in investigating the relations between the illumination factor and
        productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
        The human relations theory draws its backing mainly from the field of social Psychology and from other related
        fields. Drawing a theoretical framework from these fields, concepts on leadership and motivation, change,
        conflict, and communication are studied and researched in the context of the industrial revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Theorists like Agyris, Barnard, Simon, Likert, McGregor, and others have made available contributions to this
        school of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        The human relations contend that an employee must be treated as a human being and not as a mere factor of
        production.
    </p>

    <h3>Management Science or Quantitative School of Thought</h3>
    <p>
        The management science approach stresses the use of quantitative techniques and methods in decision making. This
        approach advocates a logical sequence of problem formulation, gathering information and data, constructing
        mathematical models, exploring tentative solutions, testing the suggested solutions, and executing them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Quantitative tools commonly used are: waiting line theory or queuing, linear programming, program evaluation
        review techniques (PERT), critical path method (CPM), Monte Carlo method, decision theory, simulation theory,
        probability theory, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of quantitative techniques in the decision-making process is known as Operations Research (OR).
    </p>

    <h3>Modern Management</h3>
    <p>
        This theory is not a single view or theory expressed or formulated by a particular theorist. It has taken
        different directions and is still in the process of evolving. The contributors to Modern management theory come
        from the behavioral sciences, operations research, management science, and contingency or situational theory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Harold Kontz contends that the development of modern management theory has led to a destructive jungle warfare
        and the management theory looks like a jungle.
    </p>

    <h4>Modern Management can be classified into three different levels:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Top management</li>
        <li>Middle management</li>
        <li>Supervisory management (Operational or First level)</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Top Management level</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Develops and reviews long-range plans and strategies.</li>
        <li>Evaluates overall performance of various departments and ensures cooperation.</li>
        <li>Involves in the selection of key personnel.</li>
        <li>Consults subordinates, manages, on subjects or problems of general scope.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Middle Management Level</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Makes plans of intermediate range and prepares long-range plans for review by top management.</li>
        <li>Analyzes managerial performance to determine capability and readiness for promotion.</li>
        <li>Establishes departmental policies.</li>
        <li>Counsels subordinates on production, personnel, or other problems.</li>
        <li>Selects and recruits personnel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Supervisory Management level</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Makes detailed, short-range operating plans.</li>
        <li>Reviews performance of subordinates.</li>
        <li>Supervises day-to-day operations.</li>
        <li>Makes specific task assignments.</li>
        <li>Maintains close contact with operative employees.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Module 2: Organizing</h2>
    
    <h3>Organizing Technical Activities</h3>
    <p>
        The engineer manager needs to acquire various skills in management, including those for organizing technical
        activities. Nowadays, skills in organizing contribute largely to the accomplishment of the objectives of many
        organizations, whether they are private businesses or otherwise. The opportunities offered by skillful organizing
        are too important for the engineer manager to ignore.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Organizing is undertaken to facilitate the implementation of plans.</li>
        <li>In effective organizing, steps are undertaken to break down the total jobs into more manageable man-size jobs.
            Doing these will make it possible to assign particular tasks to particular persons.</li>
        <li>In turn, these will help facilitate the assignment of authority, responsibility, and accountability for certain
            functions and tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Distinction between "organization," "management," and "system"</h3>
    <p>
        The distinction between organization, management, and system is important and must be fully appreciated. We organize
        to manage, and we manage largely through the system. We manage successfully when we apply not only the principles
        fundamental to correct organization and system but also when we take into account all the principles and methods of
        industrial management. Management is the whole of which organization, system, industrial psychology, and other
        elements and methods are parts.
    </p>
    <p>"A person may be a good systematizer, and yet not be a good organizer, and even a poor manager."</p>
    
    <h3>Organizing Definition</h3>
    <p>
        Organizing is defined as the grouping of work activities necessary to attain planned targets and objectives, the
        assignment of grouping to a manager with adequate authority, the proper coordination in the organizational
        structure. Organizing is a management function that refers to "the structuring of resources and activities to
        accomplish objectives in an efficient and effective manner."
    </p>
    <p>The arrangement or relationship of positions within an organization is called the structure. The result of the
        organizing process is the structure.</p>
    
    <h3>The Purpose of Structure</h3>
    <p>The structure serves some very useful purposes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>It defines the chain of authority for individuals and departments.</li>
        <li>It defines formal reporting relationships, the number of levels in the hierarchy of the organization, and span
            of control.</li>
        <li>It defines the groupings of individuals into departments and departments into organizations.</li>
        <li>It defines the system to effect coordination of effort in both vertical (authority) and horizontal (tasks)
            directions.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>When Structuring an Organization</h3>
    <p>The engineer manager must be concerned with the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Division of labor - determining the scope of work and how it is combined in a job.</li>
        <li>Delegation of authority - the process of assigning various degrees of decision-making authority to subordinates.
        </li>
        <li>Departmentation - the grouping of related jobs, activities, or processes into major organizational subunits.
        </li>
        <li>Span of control - the number of people who report directly to a given manager.</li>
        <li>Coordination - the linking of activities in the organization that serves to achieve a common goal or objective.
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>THE FORMAL ORGANIZATION</h3>
    <p>The formal organization is the "structure that details lines of responsibilities, authority, and position." What is depicted in the organization chart is the formal organization. It is a planned structure, and it represents the deliberate attempt to establish patterned relationships among components that will meet the objectives effectively.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It refers to the defined and visible organizational structure.</li>
        <li>Formal positions, with their corresponding authority and responsibility, are known to all.</li>
        <li>The table of organization reflects lines of authority and relationships.</li>
        <li>Systems and procedures are specified and instruct all concerned on their roles and methods of work.</li>
        <li>Properly organized and managed, it enforces strict adherence to established policies and procedures for group achievement of organizational goals.</li>
        <li>It operates under the principle of unity of objective and efficiency of operations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The structure is described by management through:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Organization chart</li>
        <li>Organizational manual</li>
        <li>Policy manuals</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The organization chart is a diagram of the organization's official positions and formal lines of authority.</p>
    <p>The organizational manual provides a written description of authority relationships, details the functions of major organizational units, and describes job procedures.</p>
    <p>The policy manual describes personnel activities and company policies.</p>
    

    <h3>INFORMAL ORGANIZATION</h3>
    <p>- There are instances when members of an organization spontaneously form a group with friendship as a personal reason for belonging. This group is called an informal group. It is a part of the formal organization and does not have a formal performance purpose.</p>
    <p>- Informal groups are often very useful in the accomplishment of major tasks especially if these tasks conform with the expectations of the informal group.</p>
    <p>- The informal organization, useful as it is, is "vulnerable to expediency, manipulations and opportunism (Raymund F. Valentine." Dangers of the informal organization", "World Executive Digest, March 1982).</p>
    <p>- It refers to the behavioral, informal, and undefined relationships and working climate within the organization.</p>
    <p>- The authority and power of executives and employees are determined not by their title but by relationships, years of experience in the firm, of affinity through kinships, regional or ethnic origins, religion, schooling, or other human relationships.</p>
    <p>- Groupings may be small or nebulous, members shifting from group to group and according to shared interest or goals.</p>
    <p>- The communication links are loosely held.</p>
    <p>- There is much flexibility and sometimes creativity in informal organization.</p>
    <p>- The engineer manager is therefore warned that he must be on the lookout for the possible difficulties that the informal group may cause to the organization. It could be in his best interests if he could make the informal groups work for the organization.</p>

    <h3>Reasons or Factors for Joining or Forming an Informal Group</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Friendship</li>
        <li>Common interest - like concern for the environment or love for classical music</li>
        <li>Proximity - which gives people the chance to share ideas, opinions, and feelings.</li>
        <li>Need Satisfaction - derived from unions, cultural societies, fraternities, etc.</li>
        <li>Collective power - derived from unions, fraternities, etc.</li>
        <li>Group Goals - which attract individuals like consumer society, sports club, etc.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Informal Structure - Unofficial but important working relationships between
    members.</p>
    
    <h3>Importance of Organizing Process</h3>
    <p>The organizing process will make it possible to attain the purpose of the organization (as defined previously in the
        planning function).</p>
    
    <h3>Benefits of Organizing</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>A clarified environment</li>
        <li>A coordinated environment</li>
        <li>A formal decision-making structure</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>The Organizing Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Consider plans and objectives.</li>
        <li>Determine the work activities necessary to accomplish objectives.</li>
        <li>Classify and group activities.</li>
        <li>Assign work and functional definition.</li>
        <li>Design a hierarchy of relationships.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The principle functional definition - establishing departments, the nature, purpose,
    tasks, and performance of the department must first be determined as a basis for
    authority.</p>
    
    <h3>Approaches to Organizing</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Functional</li>
        <li>Geographic</li>
        <li>Product Line Approach</li>
        <li>Customer Approach</li>
        <li>Matrix Approach</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>I. Functional Approach</h3>
    <p>
        This is a form of departmentation in which everyone engaged in one functional activity, such as engineering, or
        marketing, is grouped into one unit.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Functional Approach:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The most common approach</li>
        <li>Group activities under major departments/functional areas.</li>
        <li>Each major function is broken down into its various subdivisions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Avoid overlapping in the execution of basic business activities.</li>
        <li>Simplifies training.</li>
        <li>Provides occupational specialization.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Communication difficulties.</li>
        <li>Lack of cooperation between functional areas.</li>
        <li>Does not develop generalists in the management areas.</li>
        <li>Potential internal rivalry among functional areas.</li>

    <h2>Major Organizational Concepts</h2>
    
    <h3>I. Authority</h3>
    <h3>II. Delegation</h3>
    <h3>III. Centralization and Decentralization</h3>
    
    <h3>I. Authority</h3>
    <p>
        Authority is the right to commit resources or the legal right to give orders. It is vested in a manager because of
        the position he/she occupies in the organization and is defined in each manager's job description.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Relationship of Authority to Power</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Power is the ability to exert influence in the organization.</li>
        <li>Authority is positional and will be there when the incumbent leaves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Sources of Power</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Legitimate or position power.</li>
        <li>Power to reward or to punish.</li>
        <li>Referent or charismatic power.</li>
        <li>Expert power.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Types of Authority</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Line Authority:</strong> Defines the relationship between superior and subordinates. It is a direct
            supervisory relationship flowing downward in an organization directly from superior to subordinate.</li>
        <li><strong>Staff Authority:</strong> Advisory in nature. Managers provide advice or technical assistance, normally
            flowing upward. Staff assists the line departments by providing technical expertise or support services.</li>
        <li><strong>Functional Authority:</strong> Delegated to an individual over specific activities undertaken by
            personnel in other departments.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>II. Delegation</h3>
    <p>
        Delegation is the passing of formal authority to another person. Superiors delegate authority down to subordinates
        to facilitate work. Delegation creates a sequence of events: assignment of tasks, delegation of authority,
        acceptance of responsibility, and creation of accountability.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Responsibility:</strong> The obligation to carry out assigned duties to the best of one's ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Accountability:</strong> Having to answer someone for your actions.</p>
    
    <h3>III. Centralization and Decentralization</h3>
    <p><strong>Centralization:</strong> Selective concentration of authority.</p>
    <p><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Dispersal of authority within the organization's structure.</p>
